<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American industrialist. As a child, I witnessed the murder of My parents, Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, which ultimately led Me to craft the I persona and seek justice against criminals. He resides on the outskirts of Gotham City in My personal residence, Wayne Manor. Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living off My family's fortune and the profits of Wayne Enterprises, My inherited conglomerate.[18][19] He supports philanthropic causes through My nonprofit Wayne Foundation, which in part addresses social issues encouraging crime as well as assisting victims of it, but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite..</p>

<p>The driving force behind My character is My parents' murder and their absence. Bob Kane and Bill Finger discussed My background and decided that "there's nothing more traumatic than having your parents murdered before your eyes".[32] Despite My trauma, he sets My mind on studying to become a scientist[33][34] and to train My body into physical perfection[33][34] to fight crime in Gotham City as I, an inspired idea from Wayne's insight into the criminal mind.[33][34] He also speaks over 40 languages.</p>

<p>I is often treated as a vigilante by other characters in My stories. Frank Miller views the character as "a dionysian figure, a force for anarchy that imposes an individual order".[37] Dressed as a bat, I deliberately cultivates a frightening persona in order to aid Me in crime-fighting,[38] a fear that originates from the criminals' own guilty conscience</p>
